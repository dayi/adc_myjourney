Homework
===

Requirements
---
There are six requirements of the homework:

### Remove the functionality to move the map when lean the phone

### Implement a new feature to refresh location when shake the phone
When shake the phone, please re-centralize the map screen to your current location.

### Implement a new feature to view the pictures
Like playing video, please allow the user to view the captured pictures when click the flag.

### Fix the issue of flag overlapping
If you flag a place more than once, there will be more than one flags. But you can only click on one flag. Please fix the issue by showing a dialog for the user to choose which flag he wants to choose if more than one flags are overlapping in the same place.

### Implement the lines between flags
Learn the LocationManager and keep monitoring the movement. Flag automatically when the user walks beyond every certain distance. And draw lines to link the flags to get a visualized footprint.
